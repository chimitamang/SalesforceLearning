This repository is used to store and share code that I am creating to learn salesforce and LWC.

I am using trailhead to learn how to use github. so far I have learned about git workflow and how to configure git.
1. To configure git: 
	- Create repositorty in Github.
	- Clone repository in you local machine 
		cmd -> git clone <repURL>
	- Configure your user name and email (configuration : --system, --global, --local)
		cmd -> git config --global user.name "userName"
		cmd -> git config --global user.email "emailID"
	- Configure auto carrriage return line feed
		cmd -> git config -- global core.autocrlt
	- cmb -> git config --list -> use to see curent config setting for all three levels.

2. As I learn about each flow stage 
I will upadte below flow structure. 
	- Create a branch
		cmd -> git branch -> use to see list of local branchs.
		cmd -> git branch <branchName> -> to create branch
		cmd -> git checkout <branchName> -> to move the HEAD pointer of git to mentioned branch. 
	now you can edit the files in you local rep with you fav editor.
